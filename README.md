# Blogs

An introduction to blogging and why we do it

## Why blog?
 - Show technical knowledge
 - For you (the student); For your peers; For community; For employers
 - Build Community
 - Build Credibility
 - Track progress
 - Make contributions to others’ development, even as an early developer
 
 ## A Short and Happy Story about Blogging
 
 Tracy Lum maintained a technical blog while she was a student and TA at Flatiron. When Tracy applied to be a developer at Rent the Runway, her future employers checked out her <a href="http://talum.github.io/">awesome blog</a> and were like, 'Wow--awesome blog! No need to give her a code challenge; Let's hire this way smart person!!'
 
 ## Other Good Stories
 
  - A student from 062617 had their <a href="https://codeburst.io/bottom-of-the-barrel-8ef73eff00f0">blog post</a> picked up by a Medium publication.
  - A student from 0217 had a potential employer reach out to them via blog post comment.
  
 ## What you need to do
 - Write a blog once per module and present it on your scheduled day
 - The topic of your post can be something we've covered in class or a technical topic not covered in class
 - The blog post should be written on your own time outside of class. 
 - Use whichever platform you prefer: Medium, Octopress, Wordpress, Jekyll
 - The presentation will be less than 5 minutes with followup questions from your classmates
 
 ## YAY Topics

 - A new package, feature, or update
